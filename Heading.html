    <h1>A very important Heading</h1>
    <p>Greeking is a style of displaying or rendering text or symbols,
         not always from the Greek alphabet. Greeking obscures portions
        of a work for the purpose of either emphasizing form over details
        or displaying placeholders for unavailable content. The name is a
        reference to the phrase "Greek to me", meaning something that one
        cannot understand, so that it might as well be in a foreign language.
